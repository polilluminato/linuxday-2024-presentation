#### Abstract

> Flutter si Ã¨ affermato come framework per lo sviluppo di applicazioni multi-piattaforma, supportando Android, iOS, Web e sistemi Desktop (Linux, macOS e Windows). La sua crescente popolaritÃ  ha catturato l'attenzione di importanti aziende del settore, inclusa Canonical, che ha adottato Flutter per sviluppare applicazioni come l'installer di Ubuntu a partire dalla versione 23.04. In questo talk vedremo come si puÃ² sviluppare una applicazione per il desktop Linux con Flutter, concentrandoci sulle migliori pratiche e sui pacchetti piÃ¹ efficaci per implementare funzionalitÃ , dimostrando come questo framework possa potenziare lo sviluppo di Software Libero e Open Source.
